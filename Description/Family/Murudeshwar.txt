A little way away from Gokarna, Murudeshwar is a town that is home to the second-tallest statue of Lord Shiva in India. Overlooking the marvellous Arabian Sea, the tower of the Murudeshwar temple rises to 249 ft, possibly the tallest in the world. The templeâ€™s presiding deity is Sri Murudeshwara, a manifestation of Lord Shiva.
