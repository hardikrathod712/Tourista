Pronounced 'kudlee', Kudle beach is a little slice of heaven that offers you much-needed serenity and beauty on your time away from home. Situated to the south of Gokarna beach, Kudle is a sparkling stretch of sand and clear blue waters that are a sight for sore eyes. Not only does this beach allow you to just be and unwind, it also has something for the adventurers! Water sports and volleyball games are a regular sight for those looking to have some fun. One of the most famous shacks here is Sunset Cafe and is a must-visit for its delicious food and warm hospitality.
